# ☕ pure-java

This repository is dedicated to learning, practicing, and experimenting with core Java concepts — without relying on frameworks like Spring.

## 📚 Purpose

To build a collection of small self-contained projects that:

- Reinforce foundational Java knowledge
- Explore networking, file I/O, JSON processing, and other core features
- Simulate backend behaviors using only standard Java libraries

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains an isolated mini project.

| Project Name        | Description                                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`endpointJava`](./endpointJava) | Simulates an HTTP server using plain Java with manual request handling. |
| [`multithreading`](./multithreading) | Step-by-step examples covering Java's multithreading concepts and APIs. |

## 🚧 In Progress

New projects will be added as learning progresses.
