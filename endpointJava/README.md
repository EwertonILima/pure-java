# 🧪 endpointJava

A pure Java project that simulates a basic HTTP server capable of manually handling requests and returning responses, without using Spring or any backend frameworks.

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand how HTTP handling works at a low level
- Manually parse HTTP requests and generate responses
- Process JSON using Jackson libraries

## 🔧 Requirements

To run the project locally, make sure the following libraries are added to the classpath:

- `jackson-core-x.xx.x.jar`
- `jackson-annotations-x.xx.x.jar`
- `jackson-databind-x.xx.x.jar`

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Compile the source files under `src/`.
2. Ensure the required `.jar` files are in the classpath.
3. Run the main server class.
4. Use a browser or Postman to make HTTP requests and view the responses.
